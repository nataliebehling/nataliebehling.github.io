                <h1>About This Simulator</h1>
                <p>Natalie Behling, a senior Visual Communication Designer major and Photography minor at the University of Notre Dame, created this camera simulator with a principal goal in mind: make those big and bulky digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras less intimidating. With photography being a passion of hers since she was little, she wants anyone and everyone interested in using a DSLR to feel confident, comfortable, and excited in pursuing their photographic aspirations.</p>

                <p>A Canon user since the start, the simulator layout itself most closely represents Natalie's interaction with Canon interfaces. However, the simulator is designed to represent how ISO, aperature, and shutter speed settings work and interact on any brand of DSLR camera. Along with practicing your skills with the simulator, don't forget to check out the "Learn" tab to read more in depth about each setting used in the simulator and the history of DSLR cameras as a whole.
