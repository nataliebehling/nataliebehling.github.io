    <p>Mr Eaves was a simple, yet sophisticated man. While consistent and controlled in thickness and shape, his iconic handlebar mustache made him stand out in a crowd. Classic and refined, he was the perfect companion for Mrs Eaves.</p>

    <p>Mrs Eaves was a mystifying and magnificent matriarch. Adorned with curious contrasts and star-studded serifs, you could always find Mrs Eaves with a silky scarf around her neck. Bold, yet graceful, she was the perfect companion for Mr Eaves. </p>

    <h2>The Eaves Family: A Licko Love Story</h2>

    <p>In 1996, Zuzana Licko of the Emigre type foundry designed Mrs Eaves (<a href='https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mrs-Eaves'>About Her</a>). Inspired as a revival of Baskerville (and later named after John Baskerville’s maid-turned-mistress, Sarah Eaves), Mrs Eaves has become Emigre’s most popular typeface, its success often compared to that of Helvetica, Univers, and Franklin Gothic. The typeface’s subtly-contrasted strokes, low x-height, and quirky, yet whimsical serifs makes this typeface unique, yet classic.</p>

    <p>In 2009, Zuzana Licko designed the “san-serif companion” to Mrs Eaves: Mr Eaves (<a href='https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mr-Eaves-Sans-and-Modern'>About Him</a>). Despite the noticeable differences between the two typefaces--Mr Eaves most prominently lacks serifs and boasts less contrast between thicks and thins--Licko cites that both typefaces were designed with the same proportions, weight, and armature in mind. The typeface’s clean, consistent facets perfectly counteracts the more eccentric nature of Mrs Eaves.</p>
