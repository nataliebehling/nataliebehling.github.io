Inspired as a revival of Baskerville (and later named after John Baskerville’s maid-turned-mistress, Sarah Eaves), Mrs Eaves has become Emigre’s most popular typeface, its success often compared to that of Helvetica, Univers, and Franklin Gothic. The typeface’s subtly-contrasted strokes, low x-height, and quirky, yet whimsical serifs makes this typeface unique, yet classic. -->

Despite the noticeable differences between the two typefaces--Mr Eaves most prominently lacks serifs and boasts less contrast between thicks and thins--Licko cites that both typefaces were designed with the same proportions, weight, and armature in mind. The typeface’s clean, consistent facets perfectly counteracts the more eccentric nature of Mrs Eaves.-->
